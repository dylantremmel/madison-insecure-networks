This data set shows the routers in Madison, New Jersey, that either have no encryption or use a non-secure encryption protocol (namely WEP). When routers aren't properly secured, hackers can easily exploit them, leading to widespread attacks that are both time-consuming and costly to fix. With many insecure routers in Madison, both residents and businesses are vulnerable to these risks. Sharing this data is crucial so that officials can implement policies that compel people to update or replace their routers, thereby reducing the threat.
