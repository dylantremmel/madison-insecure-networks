This data set presents the routers with either no or non-secure encryption in Madison, New Jersey. Hackers can exploit weaknesses in router configuration and lack of encryption to launch widespread attacks that are time consuming and expense to reconcile. Having a lot of insecure routers put Madison's residents and businesses at risk, so it's important to share this data so officials can enforce policies that require people to update or replace their routers.
